# Tokyo-2020
Final Project of the subject of Algorithms and Data Structures @FEUP 2019/2020 (2019/2), with my classmates [Diogo](https://github.com/diogoabnunes) and [FÃ¡bio](https://github.com/FabioMiguel2000)

Project Grade: 18


In the 1st part of this project we had to create a program that could manage the portuguese delegation in the Olympic Games of Tokyo 2020. We created classes for athletes and staff members, medals, delegation, and also methods for CRUDE, searching and sorting.

In the 2nd part of this project we had to make a BST with records, a priority queue with the availability of the staff members, and a hash table with the old and current employees.
